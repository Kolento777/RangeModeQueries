RangeModeQueries

We store the source code in different directories, and each of them is named after the same abbreviation used in our paper.

And once you finish running the code, you will get one txt file.

For exact range mode query, you could use linux command diff to compare the result with the input data.

For approximate range mode query, you could use the our test progrm (main.cpp in the test folder) to check the correctness.
